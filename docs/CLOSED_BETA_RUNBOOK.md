# Closed Beta Runbook

## Scope

This runbook is the shortest path from local verification to a release-candidate bundle for the current closed beta build.

It assumes:

- the repo root is your working directory
- Go, `wire`, and the local toolchain are already installed
- the server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8082` by default

For beta user machines that install the released CLI, Go is not required. Only the development-from-source flow below uses `go run`.

## 1. Local Development Run

Start the local development server:

```bash
make generate
OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE=secrets/crux-openai-api-key make run-local-google-stub
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8082/` and sign in with Google. In this local-dev path the Google round-trip is served by the local OAuth stub, so you do not need real GCP credentials.

If you want to test against a real Google app instead, use:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE=secrets/crux-openai-api-key make run
```

Required runtime auth envs for the web flow:

- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

Optional:

- `AUTH_GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` if you want to restrict sign-in to specific email domains
- `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE` if you want matching Google emails to join a pre-seeded org or inherit fixed roles

From another shell, run the CLI against the local server. These commands are for source development:

```bash
go run ./cmd/crux setup --server http://127.0.0.1:8082 --token <CLI_TOKEN_FROM_DASHBOARD>
go run ./cmd/crux workspace
go run ./cmd/crux snapshot --file examples/config-snapshot.json
go run ./cmd/crux session
go run ./cmd/crux collect --watch --recent 1 --interval 30m
go run ./cmd/crux reports
go run ./cmd/crux audit
```

Notes:

- In the MVP, every connected repository rolls into one shared workspace per organization.
- `crux setup` is the shortest onboarding path and includes the initial workspace connection and first local session upload automatically.
- installed macOS beta machines also get background collection automatically when setup can register a launchd agent
- `crux connect` remains available when you need to reconnect a different repo manually.
- `crux collect --watch` keeps session and snapshot uploads flowing while the shared workspace is being observed by reacting to session file changes and using the interval as a fallback scan.
- Reports are now read-only feedback reports for the user; nothing is auto-applied.

If you want a beta machine to keep uploading usage data without repeated manual CLI runs, keep a long-lived collector running:

```bash
crux collect --watch --recent 1 --interval 30m
```

Notes:

- Prefer the installed `crux` command for long-lived beta machine setup. On supported installed macOS environments, `crux setup --server ...` now enrolls that background collector automatically.
- The collector stores a session cursor locally and uploads every new logical session after that cursor, so `--recent 1` only limits the initial backfill when no cursor exists yet.
- Keep `crux collect` without `--watch` for one-off manual uploads.

For beta users who should install from GitHub Releases instead of an unpacked bundle:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Royaltyprogram/aiops/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
CRUX_VERSION=0.1.0-beta.1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Royaltyprogram/aiops/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The installer downloads the matching release bundle, installs it under `~/.local/share/crux/<version>`, and writes a wrapper to `~/.local/bin/crux`.
That release install uses a prebuilt binary, so Go is not required on the beta machine.

## 2. Local Verification

Run the fast confidence checks:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run the closed beta smoke with a seeded beta user:

`make closed-beta-smoke` expects `BETA_SMOKE_CLI_TOKEN`, which you issue from the dashboard after signing in with Google.

`make closed-beta-prod-smoke` uses a local OAuth stub plus an ephemeral MySQL container and stays fully automated. It seeds a beta user, starts the server in `APP_MODE=prod`, completes a synthetic Google sign-in, issues a CLI token, and runs the CLI smoke flow without a browser.

Run the real `APP_MODE=prod` smoke locally:

```bash
make closed-beta-prod-smoke
```

Run the same smoke against the ignored local secret files under `secrets/` and require the research agent to use the live OpenAI path:

```bash
JWT_SECRET_FILE_OVERRIDE=secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE_OVERRIDE=secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE_OVERRIDE=secrets/crux-openai-api-key \
EXPECT_RESEARCH_MODE=openai_responses_api \
make closed-beta-prod-smoke
```

Run the full beta CI-equivalent path locally:

```bash
make ci-beta
```

## 3. Runtime Secrets

For closed beta or production, do not use the local demo path.

Preferred runtime secret inputs:

- `JWT_SECRET_FILE`
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_FILE`
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`
- `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE`
- `DB_DSN_FILE` if using MySQL
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE` for the cloud research agent
- `HTTP_ALLOWED_CIDRS`
- `HTTP_ADMIN_ALLOWED_CIDRS`
- `HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`

Supported file-based secret envs:

- `JWT_SECRET_FILE`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE`
- `DB_DSN_FILE`
- `APP_API_TOKEN_FILE`
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_FILE`
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`
- `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE`

Bootstrap users are pre-seeded Google-linked identities:

- removing a bootstrap user revokes existing tokens
- Google sign-in links to the seeded record when the email matches
- use them when you need multiple users to join the same org or want fixed `admin` or `member` roles before first sign-in

## 4. Local Prod-Like Run

Run the server in `prod` mode with secret files:

```bash
APP_MODE=prod \
JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-google-client-id \
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-google-client-secret \
AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-openai-api-key \
go run .
```

Health endpoints:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`

If you want to lock access down in-app during closed beta:

```bash
APP_MODE=prod \
JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-google-client-id \
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-google-client-secret \
AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
HTTP_ALLOWED_CIDRS='203.0.113.10/32,198.51.100.0/24' \
HTTP_ADMIN_ALLOWED_CIDRS='203.0.113.10/32' \
HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS='10.0.0.0/8' \
go run .
```

## 5. Container Run

Build the container:

```bash
docker build -t crux-beta .
```

Run with MySQL-backed beta state:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8082:8082 \
  -e JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
  -e AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
  -e DB_DIALECT=mysql \
  -e DB_DSN_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-db-dsn \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-db-dsn:/run/secrets/crux-db-dsn:ro" \
  crux-beta
```

Run with MySQL-backed beta state:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8082:8082 \
  -e DB_DIALECT=mysql \
  -e DB_DSN_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-db-dsn \
  -e JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
  -e AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-db-dsn:/run/secrets/crux-db-dsn:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:ro" \
  crux-beta
```

## 6. Release Candidate Build

If your working tree is clean, build the release artifacts directly:

```bash
make beta-cli-bundle
make verify-beta-bundle
make verify-install-script
make build-release-index
VERSION_LABEL=0.1.0-beta.1 make publish-github-release
```

Output:

- `output/release/crux-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz`
- `output/release/crux-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz.sha256`
- `output/release/crux-<version>-<os>-<arch>.json`
- `output/release/crux-<version>.release-index.json`
- `output/release/crux-<version>.release-index.json.sha256`

`publish-github-release` expects the `gh` CLI to be authenticated and uploads those assets to the matching GitHub Release tag.

The GitHub Actions beta workflow is also wired to publish the release automatically on tag pushes.

For manual GitHub Actions runs, `workflow_dispatch` now accepts `version`, `draft`, `prerelease`, and `latest` inputs so you can build and publish the same release flow without pushing the tag first.

If your working tree is dirty but you want a clean release candidate from `HEAD`, use a temporary worktree:

```bash
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/crux-release.XXXXXX)
git worktree add --detach "$tmpdir" HEAD
cd "$tmpdir"
make closed-beta-prod-smoke
make beta-cli-bundle
make verify-beta-bundle
make build-release-index
```

## 7. Runtime Store Backup

Export the live runtime store:

```bash
make store-export OUTPUT=output/runtime-store-backup.json
```

Restore the live runtime store:

```bash
make store-import INPUT=output/runtime-store-backup.json
```

`store-import` is destructive by design and is gated behind `--yes` internally.

## 8. Final Pre-Deploy Checklist

Run this before handing the build to beta users:

1. `git status --short` shows only expected files.
2. `go test ./...` passes.
3. The dashboard shows workflow feedback reports instead of approval actions.
4. `make closed-beta-prod-smoke` passes.
5. `make beta-cli-bundle`, `make verify-beta-bundle`, and `make verify-install-script` pass.
6. The release bundle contains `crux` and the generated `README.md`.
7. Runtime secrets are mounted from files, not hardcoded.
8. `GET /healthz` and `GET /readyz` respond successfully in the target environment.
9. A seeded beta user can log in on the dashboard and issue a CLI token.
10. A beta machine can complete `crux setup` and `crux collect`.
11. If background collection is part of the beta flow, `crux collect --watch --recent 1 --interval 30m` succeeds on the target machine.
