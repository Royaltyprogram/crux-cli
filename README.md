# AIops For AI Coding Configuration

This repository is now oriented around an `AI coding configuration operations platform`.

The product shape is:

- `Local CLI Agent`
  - registers a device
  - uploads config snapshots and session summaries
- `Cloud Research Agent`
  - analyzes token usage, raw query history, and config snapshots
  - generates ranked workflow feedback reports for the user
  - stays local and uses only uploaded personal usage data in this MVP
- `AIops Server`
  - stores metrics, feedback reports, research status, and audit logs
- `Web Dashboard`
  - shows a user-facing summary of feedback reports and workspace health
  - helps the user inspect prompt quality, workflow friction, and usage trends without auto-applying changes

## What changed

- Reports are now read-only feedback reports instead of local patch plans
- The dashboard now favors a user-facing report surface instead of an approval console
- Session summaries now focus on token usage and raw query history for MVP research analysis
- `crux setup` now compresses onboarding into one command: login, workspace connect, initial local upload, and background collection enrollment when supported
- `crux session` auto-collects the latest local Codex session from `~/.codex/sessions` when `--file` is omitted
- `crux session --recent N` uploads the most recent `N` local Codex sessions in chronological order
- `crux collect` uploads session data now and can skip unchanged snapshots by default
- `crux collect --watch` can keep background collection running during onboarding and beta usage
- Feedback reports now wait until at least `10` uploaded sessions exist before the server publishes the first report

## Quickstart

```bash
make generate
make run
```

`make run` now uses `configs/local.yaml`, which keeps the local demo account enabled for development. Closed beta or production deployments should run with `APP_MODE=prod` plus seeded beta users and secrets supplied through env vars.

`App.StorePath` remains only as the legacy JSON import location and SQLite fallback path seed. The live runtime store is `DB.DSN`.

In another shell:

For source development:

```bash
go run ./cmd/crux setup --server http://127.0.0.1:8082 --token <CLI_TOKEN_FROM_DASHBOARD>
go run ./cmd/crux workspace
go run ./cmd/crux snapshot --file examples/config-snapshot.json
go run ./cmd/crux session
go run ./cmd/crux session --recent 5
go run ./cmd/crux collect --watch --recent 1 --interval 30m
go run ./cmd/crux reports
go run ./cmd/crux audit
```

For beta or production user machines, install the released CLI and run `crux` directly instead of `go run`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Royaltyprogram/aiops/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
crux setup --server http://127.0.0.1:8082
```

Release installs use a prebuilt binary, so Go is not required. If your shell cannot find `crux`, add `~/.local/bin` to `PATH`.
On supported installed macOS environments, `crux setup` also enrolls background collection automatically. On other environments it prints the manual fallback command, typically `crux collect --watch --recent 1 --interval 30m`.
After setup, plain `crux` now works as the default entrypoint: it shows the setup hint when the CLI is not configured yet, and otherwise prints the current shared-workspace status.

For local development, open `http://127.0.0.1:8082/`, sign in with `demo@example.com / demo1234`, issue a CLI token from the dashboard, and run `crux setup --server http://127.0.0.1:8082` on the machine you want to connect. The CLI prompts for the issued token if `--token` is omitted and automatically registers the device, connects the current repo, and uploads an initial snapshot plus the latest local Codex session.

For closed beta or production, disable the demo path and seed named beta accounts through env:

```bash
APP_MODE=prod \
JWT_SECRET=replace-me \
AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_JSON='[{"id":"beta-user-1","org_id":"beta-org","org_name":"Beta Org","email":"beta1@example.com","name":"Beta Operator","password":"replace-me"}]' \
go run .
```

If you would rather mount a secret file than inline JSON in env, you can use:

```bash
APP_MODE=prod \
JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-openai-api-key \
go run .
```

Supported secret file envs now include `JWT_SECRET_FILE`, `DB_DSN_FILE`, `APP_API_TOKEN_FILE`, and `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE`. File-based values override the plain env form when both are set.
`OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE` is also supported for the cloud research agent.

Bootstrap users are now treated as managed closed beta identities: removing a user from the bootstrap file revokes their existing tokens, and rotating a bootstrap password revokes prior sessions so the new credential takes effect immediately.

In this MVP every connected repository shares one workspace per organization. `crux setup` handles the first-time device registration and shared-workspace connection, while `crux connect` remains available when you need to reconnect a different repo manually. The generated report records are now user-facing feedback reports rather than executable patch queues.

If you want to keep uploads flowing in the background, keep the collector running:

```bash
crux collect --watch --recent 1 --interval 30m
```

Installed macOS release builds usually do this automatically during `crux setup`. Keep the manual command for source development, Linux hosts, or any environment where setup reports `background.status` as `manual_only` or `failed`.

If you want a one-off manual upload instead, keep using `crux collect --codex-home ~/.codex`.

For closed beta deployment checks, the server also exposes:

- `GET /healthz` for liveness
- `GET /readyz` for readiness including analytics-store database access

And you can run the end-to-end smoke from this repo root after exporting a seeded beta account:

```bash
export BETA_SMOKE_EMAIL=beta1@example.com
export BETA_SMOKE_PASSWORD=replace-me
make closed-beta-smoke
```

For repeatable closed beta verification in CI:

```bash
make ci-beta
```

To exercise the real `APP_MODE=prod` path locally with file-based secrets and a temp SQLite database:

```bash
make closed-beta-prod-smoke
```

To force that smoke test to use the ignored local secret files in `secrets/` and verify live OpenAI-backed feedback report generation:

```bash
JWT_SECRET_FILE_OVERRIDE=secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE_OVERRIDE=secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE_OVERRIDE=secrets/crux-openai-api-key \
EXPECT_RESEARCH_MODE=openai_responses_api \
make closed-beta-prod-smoke
```

To build the CLI artifact you hand to beta users:

```bash
make beta-cli-bundle
VERSION_LABEL=0.1.0-beta.1 make beta-cli-bundle
```

That command produces:

- `output/release/crux-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz`
- `output/release/crux-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz.sha256`
- `output/release/crux-<version>-<os>-<arch>.json`

And you can validate the latest bundle locally with:

```bash
make verify-beta-bundle
make verify-install-script
```

To build a consolidated release index for the latest version across the manifests currently in `output/release`:

```bash
make build-release-index
```

To publish the built assets to GitHub Releases with the `gh` CLI:

```bash
VERSION_LABEL=0.1.0-beta.1 make publish-github-release
```

`publish-github-release` uploads the versioned bundle archives, checksums, per-platform manifests, and the consolidated release-index file.

The GitHub Actions workflow can also publish automatically when you push a tag such as `0.1.0-beta.1`.

If you use `workflow_dispatch` in GitHub Actions, you can now pass `version`, `draft`, `prerelease`, and `latest` inputs and reuse the same publish path without creating the tag first.

To export or restore the live runtime store against the same `APP_MODE` / `DB_*` / secret-file env that the server uses:

```bash
make store-export OUTPUT=output/runtime-store-backup.json
make store-import INPUT=output/runtime-store-backup.json
```

`store-import` is intentionally gated behind `--yes` because it overwrites the configured runtime store.

The bundle itself contains:

- `crux`

The installed CLI answers `crux version`, and `make build` now embeds git version metadata into `output/crux`.

For a one-command install from GitHub Releases:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Royaltyprogram/aiops/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
CRUX_VERSION=0.1.0-beta.1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Royaltyprogram/aiops/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The installer downloads the matching release bundle for the current platform, installs it under `~/.local/share/crux/<version>`, writes `~/.local/bin/crux`, does not require Go on the target machine, and installs a local Node.js runtime automatically when the machine does not already have a compatible one.
After install, the shortest onboarding path is:

```bash
crux setup --server http://127.0.0.1:8082
```

## Container Deploy

The container now defaults to:

- `APP_MODE=prod`
- SQLite state at `/app/data/crux.db`
- legacy JSON import path at `data/crux-store.json` only if you are migrating old state
- stdout request/application logs

Build and run it with a seeded beta account:

```bash
docker build -t crux-beta .
docker run --rm -p 8082:8082 \
  -v "$PWD/.runtime-data:/app/data" \
  -e JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
  -e AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:ro" \
  crux-beta
```

For MySQL-backed deployment, override the DB env at runtime:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8082:8082 \
  -e DB_DIALECT=mysql \
  -e DB_DSN_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-db-dsn \
  -e JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret \
  -e AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_USERS_FILE=/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-db-dsn:/run/secrets/crux-db-dsn:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:/run/secrets/crux-jwt-secret:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:/run/secrets/crux-beta-users.json:ro" \
  crux-beta
```

The repository also includes `.github/workflows/beta-ci.yml`, which runs `make ci-beta`, executes both the local-mode and real `APP_MODE=prod` smoke flows, uploads the verified server binaries and logs, builds beta CLI bundles for `linux/amd64`, `darwin/amd64`, and `darwin/arm64` with matching checksum and manifest artifacts, and then publishes a consolidated release-index artifact.

For a stricter closed beta rollout, you can also restrict network access in-app:

```bash
HTTP_ALLOWED_CIDRS='203.0.113.10/32,198.51.100.0/24' \
HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS='10.0.0.0/8' \
go run .
```

If `HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` is empty, Crux only trusts the direct socket remote address and ignores forwarded IP headers.

`APP_MODE=prod` now fails fast during startup if critical closed beta settings are unsafe or incomplete, including a missing `JWT_SECRET`, invalid CIDR values, demo-user enablement, static token bypass enablement, or malformed bootstrap users.

`GET /healthz` and `GET /readyz` now also return embedded server build metadata so you can verify the exact beta revision after deploy.

## Research Agent MVP

The cloud research agent is intentionally narrow in this MVP:

- feedback report generation samples up to 10 uploaded raw queries, assistant responses, and captured reasoning summaries before sending them to the OpenAI Responses API
- the generated output is rendered as user-facing workflow feedback reports with fields such as `user_intent`, `model_interpretation`, strengths, frictions, and next steps
- the dashboard and CLI no longer create or execute local patch plans

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` on the server process to enable live feedback report generation. The config loader maps `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and `OPENAI_RESPONSES_MODEL` into the `OpenAI` config section, and `OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE` is also supported for file-based secrets.
